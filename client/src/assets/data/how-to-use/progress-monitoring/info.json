    "To support individualization and scaffolding of instruction, teachers should complete a progress monitoring checklist for each of their participating students. There will be three primary checkpoints for monitoring: Checkpoint 1 (prior to week 1), Checkpoint 2 (variable dates for each set of language), and Checkpoint 3 (after Week 12, prior to Week 13).",
    "Checkpoint 1: Prior to beginning the intervention, you should complete Checkpoint 1 of the Progress Monitoring Checklist for each child in your classroom. Use your best estimate of their knowledge based on their usage of the words in the classroom or during activities. This does not need to be a formal assessment of individual terms, but rather based on your observations.",
    "Checkpoint 2: This checkpoint is broken up into three parts. Complete Set 1 items after completing Unit 1 (the two weeks of reading Too Many Pillows). Complete Set 2 items after completing Unit 2 (the two weeks of reading Just Enough Eggs). Complete Set 3 items after completing Unit 3 (the two weeks of reading Picnic with Some Peanuts). These ratings should be completed based on your observations of each child’s usage of the terms during the reading and play sessions as well as other times in the classroom.",
    "Checkpoint 3: This checkpoint should be completed after the Units 4, 5, and 6 are finished and before the start of Unit 7. The information from Checkpoint 3 can be used by you to identify how best to modify and target dialogic reading questions during the final weeks of RPM.",
    "Note. Although these are scheduled checkpoints, it is often helpful to take notes of children’s knowledge throughout the weeks. For example, if a child correctly uses the term more for the first time during Unit 4, it is ok to mark that on their progress monitoring sheet then rather than waiting all the way until the end of Unit 6."
